                    Why not use <strong>tables</strong>
                    for layout in HTML?

                    <li>It's good to separate content from layout
But this is a fallacious argument; Cliche Thinking. I guess it's true that using the table element for layout has little to do with tabular data. So what? Does my boss care? Do my users care?</li>
                    <li>Readability of the code
I think it's the other way around. Most people understand HTML, few understand CSS.</li>
                    <li>It's better for SEO not to use tables
Why? Can anybody show some evidence that it is? Or a statement from Google that tables are discouraged from an SEO perspective?</li>
                    <li>Tables are slower.
An extra tbody element has to be inserted. This is peanuts for modern web browsers. Show me some benchmarks where the use of a table significantly slows down a page.</li>
                    <li>A layout overhaul is easier without tables, see css Zen Garden.
Most web sites that need an upgrade need new content (HTML) as well. Scenarios where a new version of a web site only needs a new CSS file are not very likely. Zen Garden is a nice web site, but a bit theoretical. Not to mention its misuse of CSS.</li>
